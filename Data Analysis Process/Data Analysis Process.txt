Data Analysis Process:
	• Asking Questions
		○ Got Data from any sources, What is the problem statement 
		○ Got data but no insights given;
			§ What feature will contribute to my analysis?
			§ What feature are not important for my analysis?
			§ Which features have a strong Correlation?
			§ For i need to data pre-processing
			§ What kind of feature manipulation/engineering is required
			
	• Data Wrangling 
		○ Gathering Data
			§ Csv files
			§ API
			§ Web scrapping
			§ Databases
            
		○ Assessing Data
			§ No of rows/columns(shape)
			§ Data type of various columns(info())
			§ Checking for Missing values(info())
			§ Check for duplicate data(is_unique())
			§ Memory Occupied by dataset(info)
			§ High level mathematical overview of the data (describe)
            
		○ Cleaning Data
			§ Missing Data (e.g Mean,Median....)
			§ Remove duplicated data(drop_duplicates)
			§ Incorrect data type (astype)
            
	• EDA
		○ Explore:
			§ Finding Correlation & Covariance 
			§ Doing Univariate and multivariate analysis
			§ Plotting Graphs(data visualization)
			
		○ Augment your Data:
			§ Removing Outliers (Box plots)
			§ Merging Dataframes
			§ Adding new column 
		More or less this is feature engineering. 
        
	• Drawing conclusion
		○ ML Techniques 
		○ Inferential Statistics 
		○ Descriptive Statistics on DA role
			§ Is rohit sharma a better batsman in 2nd innings 
			§ Does being a female increase your chances of survival?
			§ Is delhi the most costlyy place for eating out
            
	• Communicating Results/Story Telling :- 
		○ In person
		○ Reports
		○ Blog Post 
		○ PPT's
